<b>Atelier Ueda</b> is an <i>Atelier de Software</i> dedicated to:

- Solve a daily problem.
- Be affordable, or free if possible.

The software here may look slightly strange due to a unique approach to solving a unique problem.
If you are lucky, there may be a software product here that solves a small problem that you are bothering.  

I believe that the value of a software product arises when people use it, and that software that is not used by anyone has zero value, no matter how great, large, or interesting it is. So, if you like them and use them, there is no greater joy than that.
