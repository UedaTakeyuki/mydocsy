# What is Atelier UEDA?

{{% blocks/section %}}
<b>Atelier Ueda</b> is an <i>Atelier de Software</i> dedicated to:

- figuring out a functional idea to solve a daily problem that is overlooked unexpectedly even though they are faced by someone somewhere in the world.
- implementing the idea as a software product to solve the problem practically, not theoretically.
- Releasing and publishing the software product to solve a problem by making it widely available to people troubled by the problem.

The software products produced by Atelier Ueda may seem to be addressing unfamiliar, even weird problems. But these are a collection of answers that were found by working sincerely to solve problems that someone had bothered. 
If you are lucky, there may be a software product here that solves a small problem that you are bothering.  

I believe that the value of a software product arises when people use it, and that software that is not used by anyone has zero value, no matter how great, large, or interesting it is. So, if you like them and use them, there is no greater joy than that.

# Our Creed for Making Good Software Products.
{{< blocks/link-down color="dark" >}}

{{% blocks/section %}}
1. to have genuine <b>ideas</b> to express;
2. to study the <b>coding</b> attentively, so as to know how to express them;
3. to sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous <b>software products</b>, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote; and
4. most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good <b>software products</b>.

For a long time, my interest has been thinking about what makes a good software product. Throughout my time as a member and manager of software development projects, as a software engineering researcher, and as an independent developer, I have always been concerned about what makes good software. Some of the software products I've encountered, either as a provider or as a user, are obviously good, and some are obviously bad. So how can we create good software products?

One day I happened to read the [doctrines of the Pre-Raphaelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood#Early_doctrines) and I was moved. Those four rules seem reasonable for making a painting good. And I thought the situation was the same for software products.

So, as a test, I wrote out a rule that replaced words like art, picture, and statue in the original rule with the word software product. As a result, I’m convinced that these are exactly the beliefs I should espouse for making good software products.
